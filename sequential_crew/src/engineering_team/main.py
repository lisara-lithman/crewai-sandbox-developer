requirements = """
A personal finance dashboard.
The system should allow users to log income and expenses, selecting a category (e.g., Food, Rent, Entertainment, Savings) and providing the amount.
The system should allow users to set monthly budget limits for each category and trigger a warning/alert in the UI if a new expense exceeds that category's budget.
The system should calculate the total savings rate and identify the top spending category.
The data MUST be managed entirely in active memory (no database or file saving required).
The frontend MUST feature a clean, multi-tab layout:
- Tab 1: Financial Dashboard, displaying a clean table (Dataframe) of all transactions, the current total balance, savings rate, and any active budget alerts. The dashboard must update dynamically whenever transactions are added.
- Tab 2: Transaction Entry, providing interactive forms to Log Income and Log Expense.
- Tab 3: Budget Settings, allowing users to define category budgets.
